# Introduction
This project addresses the growing wildfire threat in British Columbia (B.C.). Wildfires have escalated in recent years, causing environmental, economic, and health issues. We're developing a GIS-based decision support system for managing B.C. wildfires from 2013 to 2021. This system will identify high-risk zones and aid in recovery and mitigation planning.

# Research Questions
1. High-Risk Areas: Where are the high-risk wildfire zones in B.C. based on local conditions?

2. GIS for Disaster Management: How can GIS assist disaster management officials and policymakers?
